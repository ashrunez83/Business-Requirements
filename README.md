Driver Pass Business Requirements

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
•	The client is Driver Pass , and the purpose of this project is to provide people with better driver training to prepare them for the DMV test. The client wants to do this by giving their customers access to online classes, quizzes, and the ability to make online reservations.


What did you do particularly well?
I submitted all requirements of the system as a whole in a well organized format.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There are none I would revise or improve, I feel that I did a great job in capturing all of the requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I interpreted the customer's needs with thorough communiciation and documentation. This is very important to the process as it affects the overall outcome of the system design.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by first understanding the problem and user needs, then breaking the system into smaller, manageable components. I use techniques like use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams to visualize functionality and structure before coding. In the future, I plan to continue applying UML modeling, iterative design, and user feedback loops to analyze and refine systems, ensuring they’re both functional and user-friendly.
